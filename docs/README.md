## 📊 How Documentation Flows

```
New Feature Created
        ↓
AI follows: docs/for-ai/FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md
        ↓
AI writes code + comments
        ↓
AI creates: docs/for-human/FEATURE_NAME.md (using template)
        ↓
AI updates: docs/for-ai/README.md (adds reference)
        ↓
Human reads: docs/for-human/FEATURE_NAME.md (understands it)
        ↓
Done! ✓
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### For Creating New Docs

1. **Identify audience:** Human or AI?
2. **Choose format:** Use appropriate template
3. **Keep it concise:** Don't repeat info from other docs
4. **Link references:** Point to related docs
5. **Update index:** Add entry to this file

### For Maintaining Docs

1. **Keep in sync:** When code changes, update docs
2. **Remove outdated:** Delete docs for removed features
3. **Version docs:** Keep old docs in archive if needed
4. **Review regularly:** Check for broken links

## 📞 When to Create Docs

### Create FOR-HUMAN doc when:
- ✅ New feature is completed
- ✅ Major change affects users
- ✅ User needs to understand what's available
- ✅ Status needs to be tracked

### Create FOR-AI doc when:
- ✅ Complex feature that AI will maintain
- ✅ Special setup instructions needed
- ✅ Multiple implementation options exist
- ✅ Edge cases need documentation

### Update docs when:
- ✅ Code changes
- ✅ Features are added/removed
- ✅ Status changes
- ✅ Process is improved

> **For AI:** "How do I do this right?"

### Success Criteria

✅ Humans can quickly understand project status  
✅ AI has complete context to work effectively  
✅ Both can find info without confusion  
✅ Docs stay in sync with code
